        A couple of years ago Lily Allen wrote a statement on her website giving
        her support to the fight against online piracy. A few days later the lead
        singer of the band Muse (Matthew Bellamy) sent her an email to give her 
        his support.
        </p>

        <p>
        Naturally the whole project went sour since Lily Allen's own career
        held plenty of copyright violations. Her defence was that she
        didn't know at the time that sampling other peoples music was illegal..
        </p>

        <p>
        Sending an email to Lily Allen to show support of her statements
        against file sharing, is equivalent to the now famous statement:
        <strong><q>Keep your government hands off my Medicare</q></strong>.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)">
        Medicare</a> is naturally run by the government.
        </p>

        <p>
        An email is a <b>file</b>, once you send it, you <b>share</b> it.
        </p>

        <p>
        So opposition to file sharing should not be carried out via email. It
        should not be posted online, since the only way to post information
        online is by sharing files.
        </p>

        <p>
        Some argue that it's not file sharing which is the problem, only
        file sharing of copyrighted material. Here comes the good part; how
        are you going to tell the difference?
        </p>

        <p>
        Naturally there is only one way to tell the difference, by disallowing
        encrypted traffic; your online banking will become exiting again! 
        Then we have to install a censorship organ which can
        <b>read/listen/watch</b> all the content flowing online to
        avoid some of that from being Lily Allen or Muse mp3's and other
        copyrighted material.
        </p>

        <p>
        This could solve the current unemployment crisis as well, since most
        people on the planet would have to work in this censorship organ in
        order to cover all the traffic. Lily Allen and Muse could start 
        off this important task, Metallica will probably join you..
