        <p>
        Patents (<b>legal</b> monopoly) were originally installed to help creators
        profit from their ideas before anyone else could. I.e. by giving them
        a monopoly for a fixed period of time; innovation could lead to profit even
        for a small-timer, since you owned the exclusive rights.
        The idea is good; but this has gone from bad to worse ever since.
        </p>

        <h3>Software vs. Music</h3>
        <p>
        Software can be seen as a set of instructions, and to simplify the
        illustration; we can view the instructions as keys on a piano. I.e. each key
        resembles one instruction, and by performing instructions in a certain order;
        we execute a program, just like we get music by pressing the keys on a piano
        in a specific order.
        </p>


        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
        By pressing the keys of a piano in the same order as someone who wrote a
        song; we are playing his/her music, and the creator of the music (composer)
        should be credited for that song. I.e. it's reasonable that other people
        cannot say that they wrote your music, you should be given special rights
        as the creator.
        </p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>
        The same goes for software, if someone writes a program (a set of
        instructions) it's reasonable that others cannot hand it out (or sell it) as
        theirs.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
        How large can parts of a piano play or a program be, before it's considered
        essential to the invention? This is where software patents are messing up this
        entire industry; i.e. patents are not handed out song by song, or chorus by
        chorus to use the piano example; they are literally handed out for just a few
        keystrokes. If composers had to check through a list of <b>hundreds of
        thousands</b> of illegal keystroke combination as they were composing music;
        writing a song would be rather difficult. And this is what's happening in the
        computer industry right now.
        </p>

        <h3>Similarity</h3>
        <p>
        To make matters worse, programs often do stuff which is quite similar. What
        Firefox does when it fetches a web site, is not all that different from what
        Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari or Chrome does. If we allow software patents
        on a small set of instructions; writing a program will be almost impossible
        in a few years without violating tons of patents.
        </p>

        <h3>Innovation</h3>
        <p>
        By allowing software patents in their current form, patents laws are
        forcefully fighting innovation, which is the opposite of their reason for
        existence. As I see it we only have two choices; drop these laws entirely or
        rewrite the patent laws to fit this area.
        </p>

        <p>
        We can all do something here, I suggest we start off by violating as many as
        these patents as we can before this is turned into law here in Europe as
        well.
